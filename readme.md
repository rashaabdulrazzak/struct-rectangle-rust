struct rectangle:

- we walk throught how to calculate area of recangle and benefit of using struct.

1. we define separate width and height and calcaulte the area of them in this case we need to define width and height to new rectangle as variable and pass them
2. to refactor the above solution we can use Tuple. It will be more clear now an structure but we still need to remmeber the first element is the width and the second one is the height.
3. we can use Struct
   to add more meaning that we define which parameter is the width and which one is the height.
